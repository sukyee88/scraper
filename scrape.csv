0,LULU,/news/article/is-lululemon-stocks-nasdaqlulu-stretched-valuation-worth-paying,Is Lululemon Stock’s (NASDAQ:LULU) Stretched Valuation Justified?,"Shares of popular yoga wear maker Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) may be off around 35% from their all-time high hit in the back half of 2021. Still, the stock has held up far better than most other apparel plays over the past year. As we enter a likely recession year, questions linger as to whether Lululemon can keep outperforming peers going down the stretch or whether LULU stock will succumb to the same forces that have weighed down its rivals. Nonetheless, I believe LULU can hold up.Undoubtedly, Lululemon boasts one of the strongest brands in the athletic apparel space. That said, Nike’s (NYSE:NKE) profoundly influential brand didn’t save its stock from shedding more than 53% from peak to trough.Indeed, Nike had its fair share of company-specific issues. Most notably, supply-chain hurdles have caused the firm (and its stock) to stumble. More recently, inventory gluts and markdowns have been on investors’ minds.Though the Nike brand entails strong pricing power, markdowns seem like the only solution to clear out old products at a time when consumers are being more prudent with their spending patterns.Lululemon isn’t immune to supply issues and swelling inventories. Industry headwinds are still hitting Lululemon. Much like Nike, Lululemon’s inventory levels have trended higher over the last few quarters. Undoubtedly, Lululemon’s growth runway looks more compelling than Nike or any other blue-chip athletic apparel play, for that matter.Menswear and international growth opportunities are two non-traditional growth arenas that are relatively untapped. As Lululemon continues investing in such areas, there’s a good chance the firm can take market share and resist a portion of the hit from a global recession.In any case, Lululemon seems better poised to pick up where it left off once the recession passes. Even if there’s more pain ahead, it’s hard to find a long-term growth story as compelling as that of Lululemon.At writing, shares of Lululemon trade at 34.3 times trailing earnings, 27.5 times cash flow, and 5.3 times sales. All multiples are considerably higher than the apparel & accessories industry averages of 25.3, 18.0, and 4.3, respectively.Indeed, bargain hunters in the apparel space may not be getting much of a discount with Lululemon shares. Still, I think Lululemon’s premium price tag is well-earned. I am bullish on LULU stock.Higher rates and winds of a recession may have curbed the appeal of growth stocks. As a profitable growth company with enviable (and growing) margins, Lululemon seems like the type of growth play that could lead the way in a world where rates could stay elevated for longer.Growth still matters as long as there’s more clarity on the type of return to expect from an investment. Lululemon’s pristine balance sheet (barely any debt) and robust free cash flows have done wonders for soothing investors amid the Fed’s tightening cycle.Turning to Wall Street, LULU stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 18 analyst ratings, there are 13 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell recommendation.The average Lululemon price target is $412.06, implying upside potential of 30.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $200.00 per share to a high of $542.00 per share.Lululemon remains a discretionary firm. Demand for pricy yoga pants and hoodies will likely hit a snag in 2023 as a recession nears. Still, a “mild” downturn is unlikely to have a long-lasting effect on the company’s growth profile.The company’s “Power of Three x2” five-year plan is still in place. Innovation, e-commerce, and international growth remain arenas that could help Lululemon pressure the competition as it looks to pad its margins further. Gap’s (NYSE:GPS) Athleta has proven a worthy contender with a lower sticker price.Lululemon’s brand and innovation-driven five-year plan may help it stave off rivals like Athleta. Only time will tell if Athleta can tilt the market in its favor as economic times get more challenging. Regardless, I think Lululemon’s brand power may be more potent than many analysts believe.Going into the first quarter of 2023, I expect inventory markdowns could weigh on near-term margins. Lululemon’s managers have already warned of above-average inventory levels. Nike and other well-run retailers can’t do much about the matter — elevated inventory is just another sign of the times for the apparel firms.Fortunately, discounting may be viewed as more of a double-edged sword than a dagger to the heart. Steep discounts and a potentially sizeable Boxing Day sale could help Lululemon overcome its sales slowdown.In short, Lululemon’s a long-term winner that’s been tripped up of late. I bet the firm will find its footing and not fall flat on its face, even with hostile conditions.Disclosure"

This is evident in the 30.5% gain of DE stock over the past three months in comparison to the 5.8% rally of the broader S&P 500 index (SPX). The stock has gained 25.1% over the past year.Deere manufactures and distributes various types of equipment that is used in agriculture, construction, forestry, and turf care. The robust demand for agricultural products and elevated crop prices have been encouraging farmers to purchase new equipment, thereby aiding Deere’s topline.The company reported a strong fiscal fourth quarter, as both revenue and earnings increased year-over-year. The company benefitted from easing supply chain woes and robust demand for its products.Also, Deere’s capital deployment activities are impressive. Earlier in December, the company increased its quarterly common stock dividend by 6%, to $1.20 per share.Furthermore, the stock seems undervalued despite the share price gain. Its current P/E multiple of 18.7x is trading at a discount of 14.2% to its five-year average of 21.9. This makes DE stock an attractive investment option.Deere stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buy and six Hold recommendations.

2,NINE,/news/article/whats-behind-the-rally-in-nine-energy-nysenine-stock,What’s Behind the Rally in Nine Energy (NYSE:NINE) Stock?,"Shares of Nine Energy (NYSE:NINE), an oilfield services provider that offers completion services to E&P (oil and gas exploration and production) companies, have surged over 427% in three months, outpacing the benchmark index by a wide margin. Higher price realizations and an increase in unconventional resource development activity are behind the surge in its stock price. The company is strategically increasing its prices across all its services. Meanwhile, the demand for its products and services, especially its cementing services, remains high, supporting its financials. Moreover, the company is focusing on deleveraging its balance sheet, which is positive. It’s worth highlighting that NINE’s business depends upon the onshore oil and gas companies’ level of capital spending and well completions. Lower capital spending by oil and gas companies could pose challenges. However, management is confident and expects to benefit from its geographic and service line diversity. Further, constraints on oilfield service equipment and incremental rig activity are expected to support pricing and, in turn, its financials even if there is no significant increase in resource and well development activity.Ignacio Bernaldez of EF Hutton has rated NINE stock a Buy due to its geographical diversity and capital-light business model. His price target of $15.50 implies a further upside of 12.65% from current levels. As NINE stock has skyrocketed, insiders sold it. TipRanks’ data shows that insiders sold NINE stock worth $3.8M in the last three months. Meanwhile, hedge funds bought NINE stock worth $90K. Nine Energy stock has a “Perfect 10” Smart Score on TipRanks. (Stay abreast of the best that TipRanks’ Smart Score has to offer).Nine Energy is well-positioned to capitalize on the increased resource development activity and higher spending by oil and natural gas companies. Its stock has outperformed the broader markets by a wide margin and is poised to deliver strong returns in the coming months. Special end-of-year offer: Access TipRanks Premium tools for an all-time low price! Click to learn more.Disclosure"
3,CNK,/news/article/cinemark-cnk-stock-poised-for-comeback-in-2023,Can Cinemark Stock (NYSE:CNK) Make a Comeback in 2023?,"Easily one of the hardest-hit companies during the post-pandemic new normal, movie theater operator Cinemark (NYSE:CNK) became a victim of circumstances. With the COVID-19 outbreak initially forcing a shutdown of non-essential businesses, Cinemark, for a time, couldn’t make money. Following the reduction of restrictions, myriad changes in the consumer economy weren’t always so helpful for Hollywood. Nevertheless, a risky but bullish case exists for CNK stock.To be clear, anyone participating on the long side of the Cinemark plotline does so against great odds. As I noted earlier, much of the recent volatility in CNK stock centers on the disappointing weekend debut performance of Avatar: The Way of Water. At the domestic box office, the much-awaited sequel to the original Avatar generated $134 million on its debut. Unfortunately, with the high production costs involved, Hollywood analysts expected more.On the international front, the movie posted a $301 million performance. Though this impressed some onlookers, China’s debut performance of $57.1 million fell below forecasts of around $100 million.Fundamentally, many investors exited CNK stock due to anticipated pressures on the consumer economy. For one thing, the Federal Reserve remains committed to raising the benchmark interest rate to kill inflation. Another factor centers on job losses. More than a few high-profile companies announced layoffs, which equates to fewer people having well-paying jobs. In turn, this dynamic kills sentiment for discretionary purchases.Nevertheless, some patience can go a long way with a market idea like CNK stock.It’s no secret that cinema pundits hoped for more magic during the final month of 2022. However, it’s also unfair to penalize CNK stock excessively for circumstances largely out of its control. In other words, the bears might be missing the forest for the trees.Regarding the comparatively lackluster domestic box office debut, the American consumer just suffered a stratospheric rise in inflation. Not only did housing prices skyrocket, but so too did virtually everything else. Heading into the final days of the year, consumers tacked on a record amount of credit card debt. Simply put, folks lacked the capacity to spend on discretionary goods and services.Also, it’s way too early to call the demise of the Avatar sequel. According to a CNN report, the original blockbuster film eventually generated $3 billion in sales, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. However, you wouldn’t know it from its 2009 debut weekend, earning only $77 million. So, just with the domestic tally alone, the new Avatar is off to a better start.Just as significantly, both films debuted during or in the immediate aftermath of severe economic cycles. In the original film’s release schedule, moviegoers were busy recovering from the Great Recession. Regarding the current debut, folks are starting to put back the pieces that COVID-19 ripped apart. These things take time.As well, the success of the original Avatar following the Great Recession should provide hope for CNK stock. Fundamentally, this narrative confirms the escapism angle that bolsters the broader Hollywood industry. As people go through difficult times, entertainment – especially cheap entertainment – offers valuable psychological sustenance and reassurance.Turning to Wall Street, CNK stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on five Buys, two Holds, and two Sell ratings. The average CNK price target is $14.67, implying 75.7% upside potential.During the third quarter of this year, hedge funds piled into CNK stock relative to their Q2-2022 position. At writing, TipRanks indicates that its hedge fund confidence signal pings as very positive. For those reading between the lines, this is a substantive indicator for Cinemark.Unlike a typical analyst assigning a rating on a stock, hedge funds must put their money where their mouth is. That’s really how they make their living. Therefore, if the institutional investors employing the brightest experts utilizing the best resources believe that CNK stock is worth a shot, it’s at least worth investigating.In the spirit of full transparency, the current financials for Cinemark don’t inspire confidence. For instance, its three-year revenue growth rate sits at -22.5%. Its net margin sank into negative territory. As a result, so too did its return on equity.However, these stats represent a recovery phase for CNK stock. Over time, Hollywood producers will likely recognize that they must focus on big blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick to stay relevant. So long as they follow this tried-and-true formula, Cinemark at least has a chance to boost its financials.It’s a speculative wager, to be sure, but one that just might pan out.Special end-of-year offer: Access TipRanks Premium tools for an all-time low price!

4,TM,/news/article/why-silent-majority-argument-toyota-tm-stock-has-weight,Toyota (NYSE:TM) Isn’t Going All-In on EVs; Why It Matters,"It’s not every day that the conservative-leaning editorial arm of Fox News sings the praises of Japanese companies. However, that was what occurred when former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee affirmed the position of Toyota (NYSE:TM) regarding electric vehicles. Contrasting with peers, Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda declared that he’s part of the industry’s silent majority in questioning EV exclusivity. Once an oddball, TM stock deserves further investigation. I am long-term bullish on the stock.Fundamentally, EVs may very well represent the future of mobility. Although their production requires an expenditure on natural resources and environmentally-unfriendly manufacturing processes, once rolled off the assembly line, their day-to-day operation features zero emissions. With climate change and concerns about geopolitical energy dependencies rising to the forefront, EVs seem to offer a win-win solution. However, Toyota doesn’t quite see it that way, leading to questions about TM stock.It’s not that the famous automaker doesn’t care about electrification. Around this time last year, Toyota announced plans to invest $35 billion to launch 30 EVs by 2030. Rather, Toyota refuses to go all-in on EVs, which makes TM stock both compelling and risky. If EVs become the exclusive standard for vehicular travel, Toyota could lag behind the competition. On the flip side, if combustion-powered vehicles remain relevant, the company would be in an enviable position.To be fair, Toyoda never stated that he was anti-EV. “Because the right answer is still unclear, we shouldn’t limit ourselves to just one option,” he said, per The Wall Street Journal. Sure enough, Fox News’ internet commentators – who typically don’t share much love for foreign companies that compete with American enterprises – praised Toyota’s contrarian move.By the numbers, they might be right on this particular issue.To reiterate, Toyota is hardly an anti-EV company. It invests in the underlying technology along with other approaches, particularly hybrid. Instead, management urges flexibility ahead of a difficult-to-navigate economic environment, and it’s this smart and conscientious strategy that may boost TM stock in the long run.Primarily, a massive impediment to broader EV integration is cost. Early in 2022, the average transaction price for a new EV stood at $62,876. Given that the pre-pandemic U.S. household income was $69,560, not too many people can reasonably afford an EV. Combined with the destruction of the dollar’s purchasing power and rising layoffs, fewer people are interested in making the transition.Second, technical issues pose major challenges for the EV exclusive. As TipRanks reporter Sweta Jaiswal mentioned, the U.S. “has nearly 124,000 public chargers that take long hours to charge.” Further, another WSJ report mentioned that the government seeks to raise this number to 500,000 public chargers. However, Jaiswal points out that McKinsey & Co. projects a requirement of 1.2 million chargers for EV integration to be viable.Further, charging infrastructure alone won’t lead to a mass transition to EVs. For instance, while The Washington Post argues that EVs are the future, the news agency also acknowledges that the power grid isn’t ready. By one study, the U.S. will need to invest as much as $125 billion by 2030 to accommodate EVs.Unfortunately, this number may be understated. For example, in California – the richest state in the Union – its grid couldn’t handle people turning on their air conditioners. Therefore, policymakers and private companies proposed renewable energy infrastructure investments to reduce the strain. However, millions of households plugging in their EVs would require a far greater upgrade.Turning to Wall Street, TM stock has a Hold consensus rating based on zero Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings. The average TM price target is $152.40, implying 13.6% upside potential.Interestingly, on TipRanks, TM stock has a 7 out of 10 Smart Score rating. This indicates that the stock is likely to perform in line with the overall market but is just one point away from receiving an “outperform” rating.Although Toyota’s decision to carefully move into electrification may seem awfully conservative, it’s also arguably sensible. Frankly, those betting on an exclusive EV future may spark catastrophic damage to their financials if they get it wrong. Thus, TM stock appears rather reasonable.Currently, on a trailing-12-month basis, Toyota’s profitability margins rate decently though not superbly. For instance, its net margin is 7.43%, ranked better than 77% of the industry. In turn, its return on equity – or the ability to convert equity into profits – is 9.51%. Here, this stat rates better than nearly 63% of the competition – good but not great.Further, its three-year revenue growth rate stands at 2.9%. This ranks better than 57.5% of its peers, which is a challenge for TM stock. If Toyota goes EV exclusive, it may have to wait years for either consumers to boost their income or for economies of scale to drive down production costs. Neither outcome looks promising at the moment.Right now and arguably for the foreseeable future, Toyota dominates the average-income segment. If society incurs a recession, Toyota is better positioned than the EV-exclusive competition. Therefore, TM stock is more intriguing than it initially appears on paper.Disclosure"
5,AMC,/news/article/amc-stock-is-likely-to-be-a-flop-next-year,AMC Stock (NYSE:AMC) Will Likely Flop in 2023,"AMC (NYSE:AMC) CEO Adam Aron’s decision to create and spin off AMC Preferred Equity over the summer has been disastrous for investors. Over the past three months, both tickers have shed over 50% of their values. Those unfortunate enough to have purchased AMC stock at its peak last June have lost over 90% on their holding. Moreover, with a bleak outlook ahead and the theatre giant burning its cash reserves at an accelerated pace, it’s best to discard the stock from your portfolios. Hence, we are bearish on AMC stock at this time.AMC CEO’s insistence that the lack of quality content is the biggest issue for movie theater chains rings hollow. We saw how movies such as Top Gun Maverick hit theaters earlier in the year, generating over $1.4 billion in revenues. It became the 11th highest-grossing film of all time, but AMC still delivered dismal operating income figures compared to pre-COVID times. These numbers make it clear that movie theaters face something beyond a simple problem. Movie theaters are losing their relevance, and it will take a lot for the firm to solve its operational shortfalls.Meanwhile, AMC continues to burn through its cash reserves, placing it in a highly precarious position. It hasn’t been profitable since 2018 and has generated positive free cash flows in just one out of the last 11 quarters. Moreover, its stock is down 76% year-to-date. With less-than-ideal conditions ahead, it’s plausible to assume that AMC stock will lose more value and sink further into penny stock territory.AMC’s balance sheet is certainly in disarray, and its management seems to be running out of ideas. A steep decline in profitability has caused the movie theater giant to burn through its cash reserve, nearly $1.13 billion over the past 5 quarters. AMC bled a massive $280.6 million in cash just this past quarter alone, representing a substantial decrease of over 25%. Ultimately, AMC has been able to stay afloat at the cost of its own financial stability, a situation that shows no signs of improvement in the near future.AMC’s total liabilities of $11.79 billion comfortably dwarf its assets base of roughly $9.21 billion. This places its equity at -$2.58 billion, which adds to the company’s dicey positioning. Unless it can become operationally profitable or find a way to restructure its financial obligations completely, there will likely be significant shareholder dilution. Therefore, it’s clear that the company faces an uphill battle to ensure all stakeholders are taken care of come 2023.In addition, the recent conference calls conducted by AMC have been concerning. No one seems to have an answer for how it can turn its prospects around, nor has anybody brought up a plan for sustainable profitability. On a side note, given the weakness in the economic environment, AMC’s CEO requested the board of directors to not increase his pay.Streaming has infiltrated the entertainment industry and created a formidable challenge for AMC. With millions being pumped into streaming services, it has only had a detrimental effect on businesses such as AMC, as well as an overall decline in theatrical movie releases. As streaming services continue to pop up, consumers have more and more access to content than ever before.Turning to Wall Street, AMC stock maintains a Moderate Sell consensus rating. Out of 4 total analyst ratings, zero Buys, two Holds, and two Sell ratings were assigned over the past three months. The average AMC price target is $3.53, implying 12.62% downside potential. Analyst price targets range from a low of $1.10 per share to a high of $7.50 per share.The outlook for AMC appears to be grim in 2023. With a balance sheet in shambles, an unsustainable cash burn rate, and competition from streaming services, there is no definitive path to profitability. Something must change drastically soon for AMC to survive. Otherwise, it will likely be forced to issue more shares and further dilute existing shareholders. It could be argued that this scenario is inevitable; if AMC continues in its current trajectory, it will continue to falter next year as well. Thus, it’s best to avoid the stock for now.Special end-of-year offer: Access TipRanks Premium tools for an all-time low price! Click to learn more.Disclosure"

The company expects its higher pricing and cost-reduction measures to drive earnings next year.Also, the company’s capital deployment activities are impressive. Stryker has been increasing its quarterly common stock dividend every year since 2009, with the latest hike of 7.9% announced earlier this month.Last week, BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman reiterated a Buy rating on SYK and raised the price target to $268 from $232. The analyst expects Stryker’s shares to swing up and down in the first half of 2023 as the company “works through continued supply chain challenges.”Wall Street is cautiously optimistic about Stryker’s prospects. The stock has received 10 Buy and five Hold recommendations for a Moderate Buy rating consensus. The average price target of $257.92 implies 6.7% upside potential.Sound growth prospects for the medical devices market and the company’s efforts to launch new products might support Stryker’s performance in the near future.

7,KALA,/news/article/kala-pharmaceuticals-the-biotech-stock-that-soared-by-218-in-one-session,Kala Pharmaceuticals: The Biotech Stock That Soared by 218% in One Session,"The general market action matters little to biotech stocks. The potential for massive gains – or losses – lies with company-specific news flow, such as positive/negative updates from clinical studies or regulatory developments.In the case of Kala Pharmaceuticals (KALA), its latest update drew plenty of applause from investors. As the major indexes took a further beating on Wednesday, KALA shares saw out the session up by 218% after the company announced that the IND (investigational new drug) application for its lead product candidate KPI-012, indicated to treat persistent corneal epithelial defect (PCED), had been accepted by the FDA.The company expects to initiate the Phase 2b study in 1Q23, with topline data anticipated in 1Q24.PCED is a complication that can occur because of a corneal injury that does not heal properly. In the Phase 1b trial, total healing of corneal defects as measured by corneal staining was the primary efficacy endpoint. Seven of the eight evaluable patients saw improvement, with six of the eight attaining full healing after 4 weeks. The six healed patients remained so until the end of the follow-up period.“In our view,” says H.C. Wainwright’s Yi Chen, “these results are very promising for PCED patients who have little treatment options. Notably, the FDA has granted Orphan Drug designation to KPI-012 for the treatment of PCED.”The acceptance of the IND application means the company has received the remaining $25 million (out of $31 million in total) in investment according to the terms of the private placement financing announced at the end of last month. Combined with the current cash on hand, management anticipates it has enough capital to last until 1Q25.All told, Chen sticks with a Buy rating for KALA shares along with a $12 price target. However, following Wednesday’s huge gains, the stock has now surpassed that target. It will be interesting to see whether Chen updates his model shortly. (To watch Chen’s track record, click here)It’s all rather quiet on the KALA analyst front. Over the past 3 months, one other analyst has chimed in with a review, which is also positive, providing the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating. With the extra review anticipating further gains, the $29.5 average price target allows for returns of 136% over the coming year.

8,TA,/news/article/robust-fundamentals-point-to-a-strong-upside-ahead-for-ta-stock,"TravelCenters of America Stock (NASDAQ:TA): Superb Fundamentals, Strong Upside Potential","TravelCenters of America (NASDAQ:TA) has truly had a banner year. The company’s strong fundamentals have been the backbone of its success, and we believe its share price still has plenty of upside ahead. The organization has massive potential for expansion ahead that savvy investors won’t want to miss out on. With experts predicting further growth and strength in TA’s numbers, now might be a great time to consider adding the stock to your portfolio. Hence, we are bullish on TA stock.TravelCenters of America continues to grow and thrive, with more than 19,000 staff in over 280 locations across the U.S. and Canada. TA offers the essentials like fuel, food, and drinks, along with some of the cleanest shower stalls. Moreover, it offers some of the most popular fast food chains like IHOP, Burger King, and Taco Bell as part of its restaurant options. Hence, it’s easy to see why TA is such a hit on the road.TA stock has fared much better than the broader market despite generating a negative return over the past year. However, in the past six months, the stock has generated a healthy 27% return, far ahead of its peers and the broader market. It still has a ways to go before it gets close to its 52-week high price of $65.33, though.Most analysts feel that the stock is significantly undervalued, trading at a hefty discount to forecasts. Moreover, the stock trades at just 0.06 times forward sales estimates, 93% lower than the sector median. Therefore, there’s plenty to like about TA stock at current prices.TravelCenters of America has seen tremendous growth this year. For the first three quarters, revenues improved by a remarkable 54.4% to $8.19 billion. In the third quarter, sales came in at an impressive $2.81 billion, 44.9% higher than last year. This impressive growth was driven by a 57.4% surge in fuel sales and a 10.5% increase in non-fuel sales. Furthermore, the company posted net income of nearly $37 million, eclipsing its 2021 result of $22.2 million, while EBITDA increased from $65.2 million to $88.6 million.The future is bright for TA as its management continues to grow the enterprise. Through acquisitions, franchising, and construction, it has managed to increase its presence in the travel industry. A couple of months ago, it announced the opening of four new travel centers and planned to open four more locations by the end of this year. Additionally, it has completed enhancements at more than 50 travel centers as part of its site improvement efforts.One of the most impressive aspects of TA’s business is its resiliency. Moreover, its business is unique because it can benefit from the same conditions that may be headwinds in other segments of its business. For example, the adverse economic conditions at this time have resulted in a slowdown in spending at its convenience stores. Moreover, its consumer motorists segment has also been impacted by inflationary pressures. However, the same market conditions have resulted in a robust fuel market that allows the firm to deliver higher margins.Turning to Wall Street, TA stock maintains a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Out of two total analyst ratings, one Buy, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings were assigned over the past three months.The average TA price target is $65, implying 48.5% upside potential.The fundamental health of TA is solid, setting it up to further capitalize on its growth initiatives and expand its network in the future. This strong foundation is supported by management’s commitment to reinvesting in the firm, which is set to pay off in 2023 and beyond. The firm’s earnings per share have grown by over double-digit percentages in the past three quarters. The company promised that it will refresh its sites, advance its technology, and increase the reach of its network. Moreover, U.S. travel data indicates substantial improvement from pre-pandemic levels despite the current headwinds. Though travel spending has moderated a bit in recent months, it remains robust and points to an amazing outlook ahead.Special end-of-year offer: Access TipRanks Premium tools for an all-time low price!

9,AMC,/news/article/amc-nyseamc-ceos-tactics-fail-to-entice-investors,AMC (NYSE:AMC) CEO’s Tactics Fail to Entice Investors,"Shares of theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) continue to lose significant value and hit a new 52-week low on December 28, Wednesday, despite multiple moves under the leadership of CEO Adam Aron to revive the company. AMC stock has plunged nearly 86% year-to-date as investors remain concerned about the company’s future amid a challenging macro backdrop and growing competition from streaming platforms.AMC entered the pandemic with high debt resulting from an acquisition spree. The company and its peers were crushed during the COVID-19 pandemic as outdoor entertainment came to a standstill. The pandemic also delayed movie schedules. As a result, theaters faced a significant lack of blockbusters following the reopening of the economy. The release calendar is expected to improve next year and beyond.AMC recently announced its plan to raise $110 million through the sale of its AMC Preferred Equity (APE) units to Antara Capital. Also, Antara will exchange $100 million of AMC notes for 91 million APE units, a move that will reduce AMC’s debt. AMC also proposed a reverse stock split at a 1-to-10 ratio to avoid a penny stock status and the conversion of APE units into AMC common stock. However, investors seem unimpressed with these decisions. Even CEO Aron’s tweet this week about requesting the board to freeze his 2023 pay didn’t stop the stock from declining further.Speaking to MarketWatch, Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese stated that AMC’s CEO has made several moves over the last one and a half years to “assuage” frustrated investors. Reese also highlighted that one of the issues that impacted the stock was that the company’s executives, including Aron, started to sell their shares last year.AMC shares were caught up in a meme stock frenzy in early 2021, which led to a spike in the stock that was not backed by financial performance. Management made the best of this opportunity by issuing additional shares to raise capital. However, the offloading of shares by the management, including the CEO, in late 2021 didn’t go down well with investors. Aron offloaded $40 million AMC shares from November 2021 but said he was done with selling following a $7.1 million stock sale in January this year.Overall, investors seem worried about the direction of the firm due to company-specific issues and a tough macro backdrop.Wall Street has a Moderate Sell consensus rating on AMC stock based on two Holds and two Sells. The average AMC stock price target of $3.53 indicates further downside potential of 8.1%.AMC’s massive debt, cash burn, and absurd decisions (like investing in a gold mine) have impacted investor sentiment about the beleaguered theater chain. Wall Street is currently not hopeful of a rebound in the stock in the near future.Special end-of-year offer: Access TipRanks Premium tools for an all-time low price! Click to learn more.Disclosure"
10,FCEL,/news/article/government-connections-make-fuelcell-energy-stock-nasdaqfcel-intriguing,Government Connections Make Fuelcell Energy Stock (NASDAQ:FCEL) Appealing,"Has the clean energy movement stalled out in 2022? Not really, though economic problems have taken a toll on promising businesses like Fuelcell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL). Still, the U.S. government hasn’t given up on alternative fuel sources, and I am bullish on Fuelcell Energy stock as the company managed to increase its revenue despite this year’s financial headwinds.Hailing from Connecticut, Fuelcell Energy provides fuel cell energy platforms that produce hydrogen. If you’re looking for an affordable stock that offers pure-play exposure to the hydrogen production market, FCEL stock is among the most obvious picks.Don’t get the wrong idea here – FCEL stock is a fast mover with a five-year monthly beta of 3.58. In other words, this is a volatile investment and is only appropriate for a small position size. On the other hand, it has great long-term potential as Fuelcell Energy’s deal with the U.S. military could enhance the company’s top and bottom lines.Working with other private businesses is fine, but having connections to the U.S. government can provide a notable competitive edge. Not just one but two different news items indicate that Fuelcell Energy has government connections that should benefit the company and its stakeholders.First of all, Fuelcell Energy has a “government operative” of sorts. I’m exaggerating a little bit here, of course, but Fuelcell does actually have an advisor in an important U.S. government committee.Specifically, the Department of Commerce added Fuelcell Energy Senior Counsel Alexandrea Isaac to its Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee (REEEAC). This committee advises the U.S. Secretary of Commerce on renewable and energy-efficiency products and services.As part of REEEAC, Isaac vowed to “advocate for American businesses to be more competitive in the global energy market.” She will also advance the “understanding of the value of clean hydrogen and carbon capture,” and naturally, her input should put Fuelcell Energy in a positive light.Meanwhile, Fuelcell Energy is “bringing cleantech innovation to our country’s most critical infrastructure” and supporting “the Navy’s decarbonization goals,” according to President and CEO Jason Few. How so? It’s simple: Fuelcell Energy just commenced commercial operations at a clean energy project on the U.S. Navy Submarine Base in Groton, Connecticut.This project is projected to operate at around six megawatts during its first year of operation and add 7.4 megawatts to Fuelcell Energy’s generation operating portfolio. Without a doubt, this represents a win-win scenario for the U.S. military and for Fuelcell Energy.Clearly, Fuelcell Energy has advantages with its government tie-ins. Turning to the financial side of the equation, however, there’s a “good news, bad news” scenario. The good news has to do with Fuelcell’s top-line results, but the bottom-line earnings picture is far from ideal.Here’s something for the FCEL stock bulls to celebrate. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, Fuelcell Energy managed to generate $39.2 million in revenue. That’s impressive, considering the economic problems that have beset American businesses this year. Furthermore, this result is nearly triple the $13.9 million that Fuelcell Energy generated in the year-earlier quarter.However, Fuelcell Energy spent a lot of money to expand its business strategy recently. Throughout Fiscal Year 2022, Jason Few noted that the company “advanced platform commercialization and investment, increased engineering capability, as well as expanded sales and marketing talent and activities.”Spending money on these types of upgrades came with a heavy cost: poor bottom-line performance. Thus, Fuelcell Energy’s net loss widened from $25 million in the prior-year quarter to $43.3 million in Q4 FY2022. Going forward, investors should insist that Fuelcell’s management focus on fiscal discipline, as widening net losses shouldn’t be allowed to continue for too long.Turning to Wall Street, FCEL stock is a Hold based on five unanimous Hold ratings. The average Fuelcell Energy price target is $3.62, implying 42% upside potential.There are risks involved if you’re planning to invest in FCEL stock, so don’t “load the boat” even if you’re a proponent of clean energy. That being said, it’s encouraging to see Fuelcell Energy working with the U.S. Navy while also having a representative on a government committee.If Fuelcell’s management is willing to focus on cost-cutting, this should make it easier for investors to envision a long-term future for the company. In the meantime, anyone who’s bullish on the domestic hydrogen market should seriously consider a position in FCEL stock.Special end-of-year offer: Access TipRanks Premium tools for an all-time low price! Click to learn more.Disclosure"
11,COIN,/news/article/why-coinbase-stock-nasdaqcoin-still-has-a-lot-to-offer,Why Coinbase Stock (NASDAQ:COIN) Still Has Plenty to Offer,"Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN), the largest cryptocurrency platform operator in the United States, has lost a staggering 86% of its market value amid volatile crypto prices this year. With many investors looking down on crypto, Coinbase’s outlook seems bleak today. Empirical evidence suggests Coinbase stock is strongly correlated to Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices, which explains the bloodbath in Coinbase stock this year, as Bitcoin has lost 65% of its market value in 2022.There is a lot of uncertainty regarding the future of digital assets, but a closer look at Coinbase’s prospects suggests the company could be undervalued today. I am bullish on Coinbase stock, but short-term-oriented investors should probably avoid the company, as it could take years for the investment thesis to come to fruition.In the third quarter, Coinbase reported a 55% year-over-year decline in revenue to $590.34 million, and its net loss came to $545 million. The massive hit to the company’s revenue came in the form of an erosion of transaction revenue. On a sequential basis, transaction revenue declined by a staggering 44%, highlighting how the company lost momentum from the second to the third quarter of this year. These negative developments sent Coinbase stock crashing to new lows following the earnings release in early November.Although it seems reasonable for investors to focus on the negative developments, it also makes sense to remain objective.Coinbase’s Q3 earnings provide investors with a few reasons to be optimistic about the company’s future. First, the company served 8.5 million monthly transacting users (MTUs) in Q3 compared to 7 million MTUs in the comparable quarter last year. This is a positive development as Coinbase is continuing to add new users globally at a time when investors are dumping risky assets.Second, Subscription and Services revenue surged 43% sequentially to $211 million in Q3, suggesting that the company’s efforts to build a recurring revenue stream are yielding results already. Interest income, which is recognized under subscription revenue, contributed the most to this stellar performance as the company benefited from rising interest rates. This is an encouraging development from the perspective of long-term-oriented investors, as depending on transaction fees will result in high revenue volatility compared to subscription revenue, which is likely to remain stable even during times of heightened market volatility.Coinbase is not just a crypto broker or trading platform – the company serves as an exchange, custodian of assets, broker, and even a financial services company that caters to demands at different life cycles of cryptocurrency adoption.The 360-degree product suite offered by the company should lead to competitive advantages in the long run. Coinbase already charges higher-than-average commissions and fees from its customers, and these customers seem to be happy to pay a premium because of Coinbase’s vast product offering and regulatory compliance. These are early signs of an economic moat resulting from a differentiated business model.Coinbase is scaling down operationally to improve the efficiency of its business while cutting down some costs, which is another positive development. Operating expenses declined by 38% in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter, which is a sign that cost-cutting initiatives are delivering results without hampering the company’s growth potential. In 2020 and 2021, Coinbase aggressively spent millions of dollars on new product development and people, attracting criticism from Wall Street analysts. Today, the company is reversing course.Cryptocurrency adoption continues to gain momentum, but it is difficult to predict which cryptocurrencies will survive and thrive in the long run. This uncertainty, primarily resulting from regulatory intervention, makes investing in cryptos inherently riskier than other assets. Coinbase, a company closely related to the crypto industry but without the regulatory risks associated with individual cryptos, provides investors with a better investment opportunity to bet on the future of crypto assets as a whole.Amid the FTX collapse, Wall Street is sending mixed signals regarding Coinbase and other crypto companies. Considering the company’s strong liquidity position, prudent cost management, and long growth runway in the next business cycle, Piper Sandler analyst Richard Repetto defended Coinbase earlier this month. BofA Securities analyst Jason Kupferberg, however, downgraded Coinbase last November, citing that the company is not immune to crypto market shocks despite its industry-leading liquidity position.Nonetheless, COIN has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, and its average price target is $71.06 based on the ratings of 20 Wall Street analysts, which implies upside potential of 104.3% from the current market price.Uncertainty and volatile market conditions often create opportunities for investors. Today, the dark clouds hanging over the crypto industry are presenting opportunities for growth investors with an extensive investment time horizon. After shedding 86% of its market value this year, Coinbase looks like an appealing opportunity that is hidden in plain sight.Special end-of-year offer: Access TipRanks Premium tools for an all-time low price!

12,NVAX,/news/article/novavax-stock-to-110-this-5-star-analyst-thinks-so,"Novavax Stock Is Going to Recover, Says 5-Star Analyst","After a disastrous 2022 impacted by underwhelming sales of its Covid-19 vaccine NVX-CoV2373, which saw the shares lose a brutal 93% of their value, Novavax (NVAX) investors will be hoping the company can be one of 2023’s turnaround stories.It remains to be seen whether that’s the narrative that will unfold, but meanwhile H.C. Wainwright’s Vernon Bernardino thinks the company will be capable of doing so.The 5-star analyst’s latest endorsement comes on the back of Novavax announcing the initiation of a Phase 2 trial for its COVID-19-Influenza Combination (CIC) vaccine candidate, in addition to a stand-alone flu vaccine candidate.Bernardino thinks that partially on account of it being new technology in addition to some “significant side effects,”mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccines’ popularity has peaked, and that makes NVX-CoV2373 an “important alternative.”“Thus,” says Bernardino, “we are positive on advancement of this CIC vaccine as NVX-CoV2373 has demonstrated high rates of protection against COVID-19 infection, hospitalization and death, comparable to protection observed with mRNA-based vaccines.”Also standing in the vaccine’s stead are the CIC vaccine candidate’s “positive” Phase 1/2 results from earlier in 2022. These indicate the “high potential” for positive results in Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing.Moreover, given the positive Phase 3 results of both the Covid-19 and influenza vaccines, Bernardino believes Novavax is “closest to a Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) and potentially offering a CIC vaccine for future global distribution.”With anticipation of a catalyst in mid-2023 from the the CIC Phase 2 trial’s initial results, Bernardino sticks with a Buy rating. That said, given the company has lowered its total revenue guidance for 2022 from the range between $4 billion to $5 billion to between $2.0 billion to $2.3 billion, the price target is reduced from $207 to $110. No need to get too despondent; there’s still potential upside of a huge 970% from current levels. (To watch Bernardino’s track record, click here)On Wall Street, one analyst remains in the NVAX bear camp, but 2 others join Bernardino in the bull enclave, giving this stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $74.25, the average target might not be quite as exuberant as Bernardino’s but could still generate a mighty return of 622% in the year ahead.

Its cost-cutting and other initiatives are encouraging signs for the company’s future growth. Hedge fund managers have increased their holdings of DIS shares as a result of these initiatives.TipRanks’ Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that hedge funds bought 2.9 million DIS shares last quarter. Buyers include Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management LLC and Joel Greenblatt of Gotham Asset Management LLC, among others. Overall, Disney has a very positive Hedge Fund Confidence Signal at present.In its annual filing, the company said that Iger would undertake “organizational and operating changes.” Iger plans to focus on the distribution of content through direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming services rather than traditional sources. Further, Disney is expected to release about 20 films in the Fiscal Year 2023. This should revive its movie business, which saw a setback, especially during the pandemic.The company launched its affordable, ad-supported subscription plan for Disney+ last month to boost subscriber growth. Moreover, Disney’s parks segment continues to perform well even after the company raised some prices at its parks in 2022.The stock appears to be undervalued in terms of valuation. Its current price/sales ratio is trading at 1.92x, reflecting a 44.1% discount from the sector’s median of 3.42. This represents a great buying opportunity for investors. On TipRanks, DIS stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 17 Buys and four Holds.

14,ARKK,/news/article/can-cathie-woods-fallen-arkk-etf-recover-this-year,Can Cathie Wood’s Fallen ARKK ETF Recover This Year?,"Investors soured on innovative tech in a big way last year. There’s no better way to gauge innovation stocks than with Cathie Wood‘s ARK Innovation Fund (ARKK), which crumbled by about 68% in 2022. With no Santa Claus rally to end the year, a number of disruptive innovation stocks found a way to sink lower in the final weeks of a disastrous year for growth investors. Though a comeback may be in the cards in 2023, it’s unclear when unprofitable innovators will finally hit rock bottom.Down around 80% from its peak, ARKK is at a five-year low. As the Federal Reserve continues battling inflation with rate hikes, ARKK may still be a ways off from turning a corner. Undoubtedly, the fate of ARKK and other innovative tech stocks still seems largely tied to the actions of the Federal Reserve.Indeed, it’s hard to value stocks that don’t expect to become profitable anytime in the near future. Oversold stocks down by 80%-90% indicate oversold, not necessarily undervalued, conditions.Capital has become harder to come by with every rate hike the Fed delivers. Moving forward, growth-focused investors will need to be more selective regarding names they’re looking to stash in their portfolios.If an innovator needs to keep investing heavily in its future, it should keep growth going strong while making progress on narrowing losses to ease jittery investors.Of late, growth numbers have been under pressure, thanks to headwinds that already have begun to work their way into financial results. The real question is how much of the fading growth is due to temporary recession-induced circumstances and how much is due to the corporate aging process.Hyper-growth stocks tend to suffer steep drop-offs in growth rates as they mature. Rising competition and a lack of moat are primary drivers behind falling growth, which can result in downward valuation “resets.”Undoubtedly, many holdings within the ARK ETFs may not be able to reaccelerate growth rates to 2021 levels after the recession has worked its course. Pandemic darlings like Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ:ZM) have crashed by 88%. It’s unlikely to recover, given the economic reopening from COVID-19 and the rise of video-conferencing alternatives.Despite the epic fall, ZM stock remains a top holding (at just shy of 10% of the flagship ARKK ETF) going into 2023. Clearly, Cathie Wood still believes in the firm. However, with so many rivals focused on capturing the work-from-home (WFH) trend, questions linger as to whether or not firms like Zoom can innovate their way back to growth. I, like so many other picky investors, remain skeptical.With a pretty strong tech IPO slate in 2023, there’s hope that innovative tech can get some relief as new issues look to garner excitement over technological trends likely to change the world. Growth stocks can still score incredible returns for investors capable of picking long-term winners. With higher rates, though, come higher stakes.Undoubtedly, 2022 was a year that saw tech investors throw in the towel. That said, there were notable technological advancements that continued to move forward.Whether we’re talking about OpenAI and its game-changing Dall-E and ChatGPT projects or Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) continued investment in hardware and software powering the metaverse, it’s clear that innovation will continue to advance, even if the share prices of top tech firms don’t advance due to the decaying macro environment and tighter monetary policy.Despite the disastrous year for ARKK and the most innovative growth stocks, Wood’s popularity hasn’t taken as significant a hit as you’d expect. Wood isn’t ready to close up shop just yet. In fact, she’s been busy buying the dip in stocks like Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN).Wood’s brave bets amplify a tech turnaround if there’s one in store for 2023. That said, it could also exacerbate ARKK’s descent if it turns out the pain in innovation is not yet over. In any case, it’s hard to be an ARKK investor here as that sinking feeling carries into a new year.Ultimately, Wood believes that “innovation stocks will eventually win.” While ARKK and innovation stocks will come back in due time, the main danger is if there’s another steep leg lower before the relief rally sets in.As such, investors should carefully consider the downside risks when going against the grain. A dollar-cost averaging (DCA) approach, I believe, seems most prudent.Disclosure"
15,CM,/news/article/cibc-stock-tsecm-a-6-2-yield-you-cant-afford-to-miss,CIBC Stock (TSE:CM): A 6.2% Yield You Can’t Afford to Miss,"Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (TSE:CM) (NYSE:CM), also known as CIBC, is one of the “Big Six” banks in Canada. CM stock has been falling recently, unlike some of its stronger peers, leaving it with a high 6.2% dividend yield and a low valuation. It even has a 9 out of 10 Smart Score rating, meaning it’s likely to outperform the market from here.Canadian bank stocks are generally known for their reliable dividends, and CIBC is no exception. The company hasn’t missed a dividend payment since 1868 — yes, 1868. In addition, it has grown its dividend at a 6.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the past 10 years and a 5.5% CAGR in the past five years. Since its dividend is already high at 6.2%, its dividend growth rate is respectable. Also, CIBC only paid out about 48% of its earnings as dividends in the past 12 months (with a 49% five-year average payout ratio), meaning that its payout is safe and has plenty of room for growth if the company chooses to grow it. A company with a similar dividend track record and yield that you may also be interested in is Bank of Nova Scotia (TSE:BNS) (NYSE:BNS), which we wrote about here.To value CM stock, we will use the excess returns model, which is more appropriate for financial companies because they tend to have volatile free cash flows.As a result, trying to create forecasts for them doesn’t work well. The excess returns model allows us to use historical numbers instead, which are tangible. There are a few steps to follow for this valuation method.First, you calculate a company’s excess return, meaning the spread between its return on equity (ROE) and its cost of equity; a higher ROE than the cost of equity is a good thing. Next, you calculate its terminal value. Add them up, and you get your valuation. Here’s the formula:We will use the following assumptions for our calculations:Average return on equity (ROE): 14% (five-year average)Cost of equity: 8.4%Book value per share: C$52.57Growth rate: 3.26% (used 30-year Government of Canada bond yield as a proxy for long-term growth expectations)Now that we have our assumptions, we’ll plug them into the formula highlighted above. The figures are in Canadian dollars:Therefore, CM stock is currently worth about C$109.85 per this valuation method. Its current share price is near C$55, making it undervalued.According to analysts, CM stock comes in as a Hold based on three Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell rating given in the past three months. Nonetheless, the average CM stock price target of C$66.28 implies 21% upside potential.CM stock looks undervalued based on the valuation method used above and its high dividend yield that has room to grow. While CIBC’s latest results didn’t meet expectations, the company has a solid track record of growing its earnings over time, making it worth considering amid its recent sell-off.Disclosure"
16,LUV,/news/article/can-southwest-airlines-nyseluv-recover-from-mass-flight-cancellations,Can Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) Recover from Mass Flight Cancellations?,"U.S. passenger carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) had an overwhelming Christmas, 2022, to say the least. Reports from December 28 note that the company canceled about 13,000 flights since December 22 (more than 50% of its services). Southwest’s reputation took a serious hit. Nonetheless, its operations seem to be recovering, and the company might still be able to salvage its honor with a customer-centric approach.During the busiest travel time of the year, winter storms hit several cities, including those with two of Southwest’s biggest hubs. This forced the airline to cancel its flights, leaving passengers stranded. At the same time, an alarming number of Southwest employees called in sick, leading to a catastrophic struggle to run operations.Some passengers were stranded at connecting airports without their luggage, while some were left with no easy options to reach their destinations. The cancellations also led to escalated disruptions in Tennessee when police at the Nashville International Airport threatened Southwest passengers with arrest for trespassing.Industry experts are of the opinion that the company’s delays in updating its operations and technology led to the overburden during the storms. The lost revenues, as well as reputation, will take time to recover.However, even though the airline has said that the issues are likely to stay for at least “several days,” Southwest appears to be going in the right direction. Fewer than 100 flights were canceled over Friday and Saturday, as per Flight Aware, and any flights from key terminals were almost entirely booked despite weather delays.“We want to take care of our customers who were disrupted, and our desire is to begin to restore their confidence in Southwest Airlines as quickly as possible,” notified Southwest CEO Bob Jordan in a memo to employees on Friday. Based on past experience, the airline might soon start deploying new strategies to woo back its loyal customers.From free bags to flexible rescheduling policies, Southwest’s attractive customer-friendly policies are hard to deny. However, after this commotion, only refunding ticket prices may not be enough to win back the customers whose faith in the airline was firmly shaken.Recall that Southwest experienced a small-scale meltdown back in October 2021, and it successfully navigated the issue with LUV vouchers for inconvenienced passengers. This time, however, a more generous amount of compensation may be required.Although it was impressive of the company to own up to its mistakes, the multiple apologies from management will not bring back passengers’ luggages, wasted money, and time that could’ve been spent with family during the Holidays. Apart from monetary compensation and benefits, it is also high time for a solid strategy to be in place, which investors and customers need to see to believe.Unfortunately, the incident with Southwest is not a one-off and is a part of a string of mishaps in the airline community over the past few months as labor issues continue to disrupt operations. This is because after restrictions were lifted, travel recovered before operating capacity could catch up. Still, this gives Southwest the benefit of the doubt among investors and customers that these disruptions may be temporary.After the incidents over the Christmas week, a significant volume of customers lost their trust in the airline. However, after the 6% plunge on December 27, which continued into the next day, shares of LUV seem to be slowly recovering.LUV stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating on Wall Street based on seven Buys and one Hold. The average price target of $46.75 indicates 38.81% upside potential in the next 12 months.Moreover, on December 29, CFRA analyst Colin Scarola maintained a Buy rating on LUV despite slashing the near-term price target to $41 from $47. “History shows customers tend not to permanently ditch an airline even after an awful experience due to the commodity-like nature of the product,” said the analyst, explaining his long-term bullishness.Disclosure"
17,ENVX,/news/article/why-should-enovixs-nasdaqenvx-stock-be-on-your-radar,Why Should Enovix’s (NASDAQ:ENVX) Stock Be on Your Radar?,"Shares of Enovix (NASDAQ:ENVX), which designs and manufactures next-gen 3D silicon lithium-ion batteries, should be on your radar. Its low stock price and strong growth potential make it attractive. More reasons to keep an eye on ENVX stock include a special presentation by its Executive Chairman T.J. Rodgers on January 3 and a demonstration of its breakthrough battery tech at the Consumer Electronics Show on January 5 and 6.  ENVX stock dropped over 54% in 2022. However, this slump in price could be an opportunity to own shares of a company whose battery tech has broad applications, including consumer electronics and EVs (Electric Vehicles). Further, any favorable announcement by the company at the upcoming events could give ENVX stock a significant lift. While ENVX has a use case in premium consumer electronics, including wearables, mobile phones, and computing, the company is focused on expanding its end-market applications. It has opportunities in new categories, including medical devices and augmented reality. Furthermore, in the EV (Electric Vehicle) space, ENVX is pursuing partnership strategies with automotive OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers). Along with its growing TAM (total addressable market), the commercialization of its products is a positive development. Furthermore, ENVX recently announced the appointment of Dr. Raj Talluri as the new President and CEO.He joins ENVX from Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), where he served as an SVP (Senior Vice President) and GM (General Manager) of MU’s Mobile unit. Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch is optimistic about Talluri’s appointment and bullish about ENVX’s prospects. Including Rusch, ENVX stock has received six unanimous Buy recommendations from analysts. It sports a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks. Meanwhile, these analysts’ average price target of $23.30 implies 87.3% upside potential from current levels. Along with analysts, ENVX has a positive signal from hedge fund managers, who bought 251.3K shares last quarter. Overall, it carries an Outperform Smart Score of eight on TipRanks. The strong application of ENVX’s battery technology in different spheres and the growing TAM are positive. Meanwhile, the recent pullback in its price provides a good buying opportunity. However, the uncertain economic environment could play spoilsport and limit the recovery in its stock price. Disclosure"
18,TSLA,/news/article/the-tesla-investor-wish-list-for-2023-according-to-wedbush,"The Tesla Investor Wish List for 2023, According to Wedbush","Tesla (TSLA) investors will no doubt be happy 2023 is upon us. The EV leader endured an awful 2022 with the shares shedding a hefty 65% throughout the year.While the culprits for pushing valuations down significantly in 2022 are well-known, Tesla’s issues are more company specific. Namely, CEO Elon Musk’s never-ending Twitter saga and its impact on Tesla sentiment.Sentiment, though, is not set in stone, and can change fast on Wall Street. For that to happen, however, Wedbush’s Daniel Ives thinks Musk must come good on what he calls the “investor wish list.”So, what does that involve? Well, first off, with Musk declaring – after polling his Twitter followers on the matter – that he will leave his CEO post at Twitter, it is imperative a new one is installed pronto. By the end of January, more accurately, so that Musk can refocus all his energies back on Tesla. Staying off Twitter will also be a welcome development, as the more political he gets on the platform, the harder it gets selling EVs “to the masses.”Next up, after selling roughly $40 billion of TSLA stock over the past year, Musk must put an end to the selling spree and “adopt a 10b5-1 plan so investors know there is no major selling block around the corner.”On to the shaky macro backdrop, for which “conservative” 2023 targets will also help. “The 50% growth target is not happening in our opinion,” says the 5-star analyst, “with 35%+ delivery growth a more hittable and realistic goal for 2023.”Some changes at the Board level will also be welcome, especially new additions with deep knowledge of tech and the EV landscapes.One simple act will also help sentiment. “Buybacks, Buybacks, Buybacks,” says Ives. “Announcing a major stock buyback program is important/key for the Street’s confidence and with the stock at these levels a no brainer strategic move in our opinion for Tesla given its massive treasure chest.”All told, then, Ives stays bullish on TSLA, but foresees things getting “even uglier,” should none of these changes be forthcoming. For now, however, the Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating stays as is, and so does the $175 price target, which makes room for one-year gains of 42%. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here)Over the past 3 months, 31 analysts have reviewed TSLA’s prospects, with the ratings breaking down to 19 Buys, 10 Holds and 1 Sell, all culminating in a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average target stands at $267.07, suggesting upside of 117% for the year ahead.

19,ORCL,/news/article/can-oracle-nyseorcl-stock-continue-to-beat-the-market,Can Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Stock Continue to Beat The Market?,"The technology giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has a “Perfect 10” Smart Score, which implies that the stock has the potential to beat the benchmark index. The company reported outstanding results in the second quarter, driven by strength in its Cloud segment. It has been able to mark its presence in the cloud market with the expansion of cloud services and product offerings. Given the company’s steady growth in the cloud space and solid fundamentals, it looks like there is more upside in the near term. Also, the company’s strong balance sheet supports consistent dividend payments. Oracle’s dividend yield of 1.57% compares favorably with the sector’s average of 1.03%. Further, Oracle acquired Cerner Corporation in June 2022. The deal expanded the company’s client base, thereby boosting its healthcare-related revenues. Further, the deal should help Oracle fully automate the clinical trials, further expanding the company’s customer base.On the valuation front, the stock seems undervalued. Oracle is trading at a P/E ratio of around 25.5x, which reflects a discount of 9% from its five-year average of 28.07x. This represents a great buying opportunity for investors. ORCL stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks based on nine Buys, nine Holds, and one Sell. The stock has positive signals from retail investors and bloggers. Further, hedge funds are bullish on Oracle, as they have bought 1.6 million shares in the last quarter.Over the past three months, ORCL stock has gained 30.2% in comparison to the 2.2% rally of the broader S&P 500 index (SPX). Moreover, analysts see an upside potential of 14.9% in Oracle stock based on the average price target of $93.89.Disclosure "
20,ARBK,/news/article/does-argo-blockchains-improved-financial-standing-change-the-game-analyst-weighs-in,Does Argo Blockchain’s Improved Financial Standing Change the Game? Analyst Weighs In,"2022 ended with a bang for Argo Blockchain (ARBK). The year’s last 5 sessions saw the shares climb 110% higher. Yet, as an illustration of how damaging the year was for the struggling crypto miner, even after the huge gains, the shares still saw out the year 91% into the red.So, what happened to send the shares soaring? Well, the company seems to have been thrown a lifeline by a noted crypto bigwig.Galaxy Digital, billionaire Mike Novagratz’s crypto investment fund, will buy the company’s Helios mining facility in Dickens Country, Texas – which includes a 200MW immersion bitcoin mining building in operation only since May 2022 – for $65 million. The company will also be the recipient of a new $35 million loan with Argo’s mining hardware acting as collateral.The deal includes disposing of all current Argo debt, and the company will get a two-year hosting arrangement with Galaxy, with its fleet of 23,619 Bitmain S19J Pro machines set to continue running at the facility without interruption.“The deal preserves the current operating structure of the company, relieves the debt burden, and prevents a bankruptcy filing,” says H.C. Wainwright’s Kevin Dede.However, that does not mean the company is out of the woods just yet. “While the view to Argo’s balance sheet is now clearer,” Dede went on to say, “the company’s income statement remains far less transparent. Argo has not disclosed its hosting costs, which we suspect remain variable given Galaxy does not yet have a PPA in place for the Helios facility, nor do we have insight on the new cost of debt.”As such, with no September quarter numbers yet to see the light of day, and “little view” to Argo’s P/L, Dede prefers staying on the sidelines for now. The analyst intends to reassess his model once the September figures are released, and the company can provide a “baseline for hosting cost calculations.” Accordingly, Dede reiterated a Neutral rating without providing a fixed price target for the shares. (To watch Dede’s track record, click here)Elsewhere, the stock receives an additional 4 Holds and 2 Sells from the Wall Street experts, making the consensus view here a Moderate Sell. The average target stands at $0.81, suggesting the stock will fall 25% lower over the coming months.

21,TSLA,/news/article/tesla-stock-nasdaqtsla-free-fall-dont-catch-the-falling-knife,Tesla Stock (NASDAQ:TSLA) Free-Fall: Don’t Catch the Falling Knife,"Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) have not had a very happy start to the new year, plunging 12.2% in its first 2023 session of trade on the back of an underwhelming delivery report. Undoubtedly, Telsa is an electric vehicle pioneer with a lot to get excited about. The innovative technologies underneath the hood of the latest and greatest Tesla EVs don’t change the fact that it’s an auto stock in the face of an economic downturn. The recent delivery fumble may be just the start as we learn more about how much discretionary demand stands to go offline at the hands of a coming recession. Down around 74% from its 2021 peak, Tesla stock is in free-fall mode, and its stock still doesn’t look cheap enough to warrant backing up the truck, given the macro risks and competitive pressures that lie ahead.Despite the magnitude of Tesla stock’s crash, shares are still up more than 270% from their 2020 pandemic lows. Indeed, many hot performers of 2020 have already completed their round trips to such lows. If shares of Tesla are headed for the same fate, there’s still quite a bit of downside left in the tank.There’s no telling how much deliveries could fade as we march into a recession. As rates continue to rise, Tesla may be re-valued as more of an auto stock than a tech stock. Even if Tesla’s impressive technologies warrant a tech multiple, valuing the company as a tech stock is unlikely to do it further favors from here as rates continue to surge.Though Tesla will survive the onslaught, I’m neutral on the stock. I don’t see value here — just mounting risk. At this juncture, CEO Elon Musk looks pretty bright for having sold off a chunk of his Tesla shares through 2022. His latest round of selling saw him dump 22 million worth of Tesla stock for an estimated $3.5 billion.Though he’s stated that he’s done with the share sales, questions linger as to how the man will balance running Tesla in its moment of pain with his new responsibilities at Twitter. The social media platform also has a lot of baggage.For now, Twitter users have voted. They want a new top boss at the helm of the social-media firm. Whether Musk can find the right man for the job remains to be seen. Regardless, a shift of gears back to Tesla may not be enough to put an end to TSLA stock’s violent implosion.Musk is urging his employees not to make too much of the vicious stock market moves. For Tesla stock investors, it’s hard not to be rattled as the massive gains evaporate. Tesla is one of the so-called “cult stocks” that many Musk believers have likely doubled down on many times on the stock’s multi-year ascent. Musk fanatics will be tested over the next year as the storm of headwinds comes rolling in.Wall Street analysts still view Tesla stock as a great buy on the dip, with mostly Buy ratings and just two Sell ratings. Indeed, analysts may need to “lower the bar” on price targets and recommendations as the stock’s brutal decline continues in the first quarter of 2023.At $112 and change, Tesla stock trades at a somewhat palatable 33.4 times trailing earnings and 23 times cash flow. That’s a historically cheap multiple to pay for Tesla. Still, the stock remains pricier than the auto industry average, which sports 21.7 times trailing earnings and 14.5 times cash flow multiples.As Tesla succumbs to the forces dragging down the auto market, it may not be too far-fetched to see the stock’s multiple contract further. As auto rivals continue to electrify their rosters, it’s entirely possible that the “tech multiple” attached to Tesla could vanish until the firm can pull ahead with self-driving innovations.At this point, I think Tesla may have a tougher time taking market share from rivals as auto demand continues to sink further.Turning to Wall Street, TSLA stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 31 analyst ratings, there are 19 Buys, 10 Holds, and two Sell recommendations.The average Tesla price target is $257.96, implying upside potential of 127.7%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $85.00 per share to a high of $760.00 per share.Tesla is still a great company with a stellar brand. That said, recession headwinds seem likely to overtake the firm’s ability to take market share in the auto space. Given the wide range of analyst price targets ($85-$760), I’d steer clear of the name until consensus targets are narrower.Disclosure"
22,MCK,/news/article/mckesson-stock-nysemck-gained-52-in-2022-can-its-momentum-continue,McKesson Stock (NYSE:MCK) Gained 52% in 2022. Can Its Momentum Continue?,"Ready for a hidden gem that outperformed much of the market last year? Check out McKesson (NYSE: MCK), a healthcare market selection that isn’t talked about enough. That’s fine, as I am bullish on McKesson stock, and it could be a secret weapon in your portfolio in 2023.Headquartered in Texas, McKesson is a diversified healthcare services provider. The covered services include medical technology, clinical support, provision of pharmaceuticals, and surgical supply distribution.Even if you’ve never heard of McKesson before, you’ll certainly be familiar with the company’s famous partner in the pharmaceutical industry. Analysts, growth, value, and income investors could all easily find reasons to start a position in McKesson stock.For many investors, 2022 will be remembered as a rough year. Folks who held shares of technology companies certainly didn’t have an easy time. On the other hand, McKesson stockholders were on “Easy Street,” gaining 51.85% in 12 months.Does this mean that it’s time for MCK stock to take a breather in 2023? Not necessarily, as McKesson shares don’t appear to be overpriced even after last year’s stunning rally. McKesson’s P/E ratio is reasonable at 26.6x, and the stock’s beta is quite low at 0.42.In other words, MCK stock isn’t volatile, and it still looks like a pretty good bargain at the current price. Plus, McKesson pays a 0.54% annual dividend yield. That’s not life-changing, but it’s a nice added bonus for income investors.By the way, McKesson’s business operations aren’t limited to the U.S. In fact, this is a large North American company with a healthcare market presence in Canada. Hence, prospective investors should take this into consideration.Among McKesson’s most important roles is to help pharmaceutical companies distribute medicines to people who need them. Therefore, it’s great news that McKesson will continue to work with an industry giant, CVS Health (NYSE: CVS).In the U.S., CVS is royalty among retail pharmacy store chains. Yet, CVS can’t be expected to deliver potentially life-saving drugs without some assistance. That’s where McKesson comes in, as the company has agreed to “extend its partnership with CVS Health to distribute pharmaceuticals to mail order and specialty pharmacies, retail pharmacies and distribution centers through June 2027.”Consider the implications of this. If everything works out as planned, McKesson will continue to have a significant revenue source through mid-2027. McKesson CEO Brian Tyler is quite proud of this extended collaboration, of course. With CVS Health, Tyler asserts, McKesson will “continue developing value propositions for patients utilizing our diverse set of differentiated assets and capabilities.”In 2022, when inflation was peaking and supply chains were disrupted, many U.S. businesses struggled just to survive. McKesson demonstrated its resilience during this challenging time with financials that remained solid and steady.Here’s the proof: during Fiscal 2023’s second quarter, McKesson generated $70.16 billion in revenue, up 5% year-over-year. Again, if that pace of revenue growth from such a large revenue base doesn’t impress you, just remember how difficult the macroeconomic environment was in 2022.During that same quarter, McKesson reported $6.06 in adjusted earnings per diluted share, down 1% year-over-year. In other words, the company held steady while so many companies floundered; this is impressive when taken in context.Perhaps best of all, McKesson raised its Fiscal 2023 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share from a range of $23.95 to $24.65 to a range of $24.45 to $24.95. This reflects “operating business performance and increased contribution from the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution, kitting, and storage programs and COVID-19 tests.” Clearly, it’s positive that the government still counts on McKesson to facilitate the supply chain for COVID-19 vaccines and other items.Turning to Wall Street, MCK is a Strong Buy based on eight Buys and two Hold ratings – and notably, no Sell ratings. Furthermore, the average McKesson price target is $425.30, implying 13.6% upside potential.What type of investments are you looking for in 2023? If you’re looking for modest growth and resiliency, you should consider MCK. Besides, MCK stock has no Sell ratings and exhibits a powerful upward price trajectory.Disclosure"
23,NIO,/news/article/2023-will-be-another-busy-year-for-nio-morgan-stanley-says-buy-the-stock,‘2023 will be another busy year for NIO’: Morgan Stanley says ‘buy’ the stock,"NIO (NIO) got off to a good start in 2023, after announcing a record 15,815 deliveries for December 2022, amounting to a 50.8% year-over-year increase.After the myriad issues encountered last year, namely the zero-Covid policies’ impact on production alongside supply chain snags, investors will be hoping the uptick is a harbinger of things to come and not merely a one-off event.The December delivery numbers come in the wake of the company’s December 24th NIO Day. At the event, as anticipated, NIO unveiled two new models – the coupe SUV EC7 and the new ES8. Both are based on NIO’s second-gen platform with the newest electric drive system (480kW dual-motor AWD system and SiC power module), AQUILA autonomous driving hardware and second-gen digital cockpit, similar to the ES7 and ET7.But given the fact most of the initiatives announced at the event won’t reach the market before Q2, Morgan Stanley’s Tim Hsiao believes “volume delivery is likely to be the key driver into the low season.”Pre-orders for the new models have already started with deliveries for the EC7 slated to kick off in May followed by the new ES8 in June.The 500kW ultra-fast charging stations and the third-generation power swap station (PSS) were also introduced at the event while “spy shots” of the NIO Phone – anticipated to launch in the spring – were also unveiled.In total, NIO plans on launching five new models this year, but as of now, only two have been released. “All in all,” Hsiao summed up, “2023 will be another busy year for NIO with multiple product launches.”So, down to the nitty-gritty, what does this all mean for investors? Hsiao reiterated an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating, backed by a $16.10 price target, implying room for share growth of 69% over the coming year. (To watch Hsiao’s track record, click here)Overall, NIO stock has received 13 analyst reviews over the past 3 months and these breakdown into 9 Buys and 4 Holds, all culminating in a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The Street’s average target of $16.14 is practically the same as Hsiao’s.

24,SPX,/news/article/can-record-dividends-last-year-continue-in-2023,Will 2023 be Another Record Year for Dividends?,"Under ordinary circumstances, business enterprises facing a possible economic meltdown typically won’t reward shareholders, whether through stock buybacks or dividends. Instead, the priority is to survive the incoming onslaught so that such rewards may be distributed at all. Yet The Wall Street Journal noted recently that publicly-traded companies spent record amounts on dividends despite numerous troubles. It begs the question, can this narrative last throughout the new year as the market and economy trend lower?At first, the sheer dollar amount appears almost fantastical relative to underlying worries. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices – a unit of S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) – enterprises listed in the S&P 500 (SPX) “allocated an estimated $561 billion toward dividends in 2022, up from $511.2 billion in 2021 and the highest amount on record.”Further, the WSJ added that “dividend spending is poised for another record in 2023 as companies are under pressure from investors to keep increasing returns, said Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.”At the same time, market observers carry reasonable concerns about the sustainability of such dividends this year. With the Federal Reserve raising the benchmark interest rate, borrowing costs naturally increased. Effectively, though, this framework disincentivized growth-oriented companies from maintaining their expansionary ambitions. Not surprisingly, then, one of the byproducts has been mass layoffs.Again, embattled enterprises’ first priority should be survival. Otherwise, it doesn’t make much sense to extract dividends from defunct entities. Yet, many companies insist that paying out passive income represents a viable and sensible approach.Heading into the new year, more than a few respected market experts warned about a possible downturn, ranging from a U.S. recession to the worst-case scenario of stagflation. Interestingly, though, unlike the Great Recession, an upcoming downturn wouldn’t come as a surprise. Indeed, this time around, businesses are prepared for potential turmoil. Therefore, their confidence in still paying out dividends carries greater credibility.For instance, the aforementioned WSJ report recognized that businesses have become less optimistic about the U.S. economic outlook.Still, as journalist Mark Maurer pointed out, “cutting or canceling dividends is generally a last resort as doing so signals worry to investors. Many companies say they are confident they have sufficient cash flow to fund payroll, capital investments and other expenses that they can capably reward shareholders through dividend payouts for at least the near future.”The last sentence above deserves careful consideration, as in reading the fine print. As stated earlier, if a downturn materializes, it’s not going to catch enterprises – particularly the blue chips – off guard. One does not need to go far to find bearish prognostications. By logical deduction, enterprises that pay dividends likely factored in key headwinds.If they believe they can still provide passive income to stakeholders, the words may be more than mere bravado.In August last year, The New York Times ran an op-ed by Jeff Sommer in which the finance author listed brewing criticisms of stock buybacks. For instance, Sen. Chuck Schumer bluntly stated that he hated the practice. “I think they are one of the most self-serving things that corporate America does.” Yet, buybacks and dividends point to the same objective: rewarding shareholders, and that’s where a key fundamental problem lies.Typically, investors can benefit financially from stocks through two mechanisms: capital gains or passive income (dividends). Under normal circumstances in the stock market, individuals and institutions pool their money together to fund enterprises that can potentially yield a positive return. However, in the new normal, these enterprises are not guaranteed to stick around.Again, with the Fed tightening the money supply through higher rates, consumer spending declined across the board. Therefore, an argument exists that companies should focus on navigating potential turmoil in 2023 rather than rewarding shareholders. The time to reward investors will always be available so long as the underlying enterprise exists. However, once the stock falls to zero, that’s it – game over.In simple terms, paying dividends during difficult times runs counter to the Israeli martial art Krav Maga’s core fighting principle: address the immediate danger first before addressing secondary threats.Given the delicate balance between fiscal generosity versus survivability, it’s probably not possible to provide a clear-cut answer as to whether record dividends can survive in the new year. However, dividend stocks from specific industries – such as utilities and insurance – will likely win out. That’s because these sectors benefit from inelastic demand or demand that’s consistent and predictable irrespective of pricing fluctuations.With so many vagaries ahead of investors in 2023, many will almost certainly pay a premium for such reliability.Disclosure"
25,TU,/news/article/why-telus-nysetu-free-cash-flow-can-rocket-this-year,Why TELUS’ (NYSE:TU) Free Cash Flow Can Rocket This Year,"TELUS (TSE:T) (NYSE:TU) is one of the largest telecommunication carriers in Canada, covering 90%-95% of Canada’s telecom market. Apart from telecom, the company also dabbles in information technology solutions. Here’s a look into why the stock might be a great value bet.Notably, most of the company’s “fibre-to-the-home” (FTTH) buildout has been done after humongous investments (TELUS has spent more than C$200 billion on infrastructure and spectrum-related costs since the turn of the century). The shift is expected to be 100% complete by the end of this year, and it will be beneficial to the company by boosting cash flows (via fewer capital expenditures) that can be leveraged in growth-driving initiatives, hiking dividends, and reducing debt.Also, as part of its C$54 billion investment in 5G infrastructure through 2024, TELUS has managed to connect more than 70% of the Canadian population to the network so far. Given that the global 5G market is rapidly growing, TELUS stands a strong chance to benefit massively, thanks to its efforts combined with its dominance in the network infrastructure market in Canada.A thing that stands out is its lower capital expenditure expectations. TELUS guided C$2.5 billion in CapEx in 2023, which is around C$1 billion below the annual capital requirement in 2022. According to an estimate by RBC Capital Markets, free cash flow in 2023 will be twice as much as it was in 2022, bolstering the financial position of the company.With solid financial efficiency in place, TELUS has been able to remain consistent with its dividend payments. On November 4th, 2022, its quarterly dividend was increased by 7.2% year-over-year to C$0.3511 per share, yielding around 5.4% currently.On Wall Street, analysts have many nice things to say about TELUS stock. The stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on six Buys and three Holds. The average price target of $24.03 indicates that the share price can rise by 24.7% in the next 12 months.The best thing about TELUS is that it serves various markets which have bright growth prospects ahead. Being a dominant, low-priced telecom stock, the path ahead looks safe despite the looming threat of a global recession. TELUS is currently a value buy, with its trailing-12-month P/E ratio of 17.9x more than 25% below its five-year average.  Disclosure"
26,TSLA,/news/article/theres-an-opportunity-brewing-in-tesla-shares-says-morgan-stanley,"There’s an Opportunity Brewing in Tesla Shares, Says Morgan Stanley","Tesla (TSLA) shares have been on the end of a severe beating in recent times, with the latest meltdown taking place after the EV leader missed delivery estimates for Q4. That has only exacerbated a stock that already badly impacted by CEO Elon Musk’s ongoing Twitter shenanigans.However, according to Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas, the stock’s awful showing – down by 42% over the past month – is “driven by EV supply > EV demand for the first time since Covid, exacerbated by technical factors.”Jonas expects the tables will turn on the EV supply/demand paradigm in 2023, with supply finally exceeding demand, reversing the last 2 years’ prevailing trend. And this ‘reset’ year for the EV market will have widespread implications. “Within this environment,” says Jonas, “we believe players that are self-funded (non-reliant on external capital funding) with demonstrated scale and cost leadership throughout the value chain (from manufacturing to up-stream material supply) can be relative winners.”Even before taking IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) benefits into account, for which Tesla is the “biggest potential winner,” Jonas thinks the company is well-positioned to “extend its lead vs. the EV competition in FY23 (both legacy and start-up).”Not that 2023 will be an easy ride; hurdles to overcome include the weakening macro backdrop, “record high unaffordability,” and growing competition, yet as Tesla “leverages its cost and scale advantage,” Jonas expects TSLA will pull ahead in the EV race. As such, the analyst sees the current share price being an “attractive entry for investors.”Based on the above, Jonas rates TSLA shares an Overweight (i.e., Buy) along with a $250 price target. This figure suggests the stock will be changing hands for a 120% premium a year from now. (To watch Jonas’ track record, click here)As usual, Tesla generates plenty of interest on Wall Street; over the past 3 months, 30 analysts have chimed in with reviews and these breakdown into 18 Buys, 10 Holds and 2 Sells, all culminating in a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The average price target stands at $257.96, implying ~127% upside potential from current levels.
